# About

Have you ever wonder how does your Operating System deals with the amount of applications you use? How are they organized into main memory? Inspired by Operating Systems classes I was having in college during the Swift Student Challenge submission period, I created a Playground Book that has the objective of explaining and ilustrate some Memory Management Techniques. The user can play and see by himself how each of the three techniques shown in the Playground work.
