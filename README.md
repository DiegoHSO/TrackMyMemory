# About

Have you ever wondered how does your Operating System deals with the amount of applications you use? üßê

How are they organized into main memory? ü§î

Inspired by Operating Systems classes I was having in college during the Swift Student Challenge submission period, I created a Playground Book that has the objective of explaining, in an interactive way, some Memory Management Techniques. 

The user can play and see by himself how each of the three techniques shown in the Playground work.

# How it was made?

I coded Track My Memory entirely in SwiftUI, since it was the only framework I learned until the end of submissions. I used as reference for Memory Management Techniques algorithms and explanations an amazing book from William Stallings, called "Operating Systems". You can find it [here](http://williamstallings.com/OperatingSystems/).

# Where should I run the Playground?

I made all the code using as base a 4th generation iPad Pro (12.9-inch) in Xcode (thanks Simulator!), but it was effectively tested on Swift Playgrounds for macOS (version 3.4.1). If you have an iPad Pro with Swift Playgrounds installed and want to play Track My Memory in it, it's a valid try. Unfortunately, I couldn't test it, since I don't have one.
