 # Welcome to Track My Memory!
 
 Have you ever wondered how does your operating system deal with the execution of your apps? From the lighter to the heaviest app, how is the memory inside your computer managed?
 
 Thanks to the evolution that **technology** had over the years, operating systems got smarter at dealing with memory and applications.
 
 ## But how?
 
 That is what we will see in this Playground! Track My Memory has the main objective of showing, in an easy and interactive way, how some of the most used memory managment techniques work! In a chronological approach, you will see how some of these techniques evolved.
 
 To start our adventure in this world, just press "Run My Code" when you're ready!
